# Admission-process-file
## Project Description
This is a project that shows how the admission for a university can be done easily

In this project, I created an admissiondetails.txt file where I put the information of students in. Their names, telephone numbers, scores, origin, age and others can be found there.
From the information given, I calculated the total scores one has to get to enter a certain department in a school like Unilag. I used Unilag's way of giving admission to do this.

At the end, we saw the number of people that were given admission and the number of people that were in a particular department.

Check the admissionprocess.ipynb file for more detais. The code is well commented and easy to understand
